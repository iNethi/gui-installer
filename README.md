# iNethi GUI Installer
A GUI installer app built with Electron to simplify the process of installing the iNethi network system. Find more details on the [iNethi website](http://inethi.org.za/software).

## Usage
This app can be built from source or run from a pre-packaged application for Ubuntu Desktop 22. A 
Windows pre-packaged app is in the works while Mac users will need to build it from source using
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### Build from Source
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies using npm from the root directory.
```
npm install
```
3. Start the application.
```
npm start
```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to build your server.

### Run from Pre-packaged Application
Find a release in our GitHub [releases](https://github.com/iNethi/inethi-network-builder/releases).
